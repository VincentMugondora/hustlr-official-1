Here’s a clear, thorough prompt you can use with Windsurf (or any AI coding assistant) to generate clean, maintainable, and professional code for your Hustlr WhatsApp chatbot project:

***

**Prompt for Windsurf:**

***

I am building a WhatsApp chatbot called Hustlr using FastAPI and MongoDB. The bot will connect users to local service providers (e.g., plumbers, electricians) in real time. Key features:
- Providers can register through WhatsApp; their details are stored in MongoDB.
- New users must provide their name, location, and accept a privacy policy before using any service; this data is also stored in MongoDB.
- The bot manages bookings and sends automated reminders to users and providers.
- All interaction is through WhatsApp. The backend uses FastAPI and MongoDB.

**I want you to generate code that demonstrates best practices for:**
- Readability:  
  - Use clear variable and function names
  - Apply consistent formatting
  - Keep structures simple
  - Only use necessary comments
  - Follow the PEP8 style guide for Python
- Maintainability:
  - Functions should do only one thing (Single Responsibility Principle)
  - Code should be modular and reusable, following a clean folder structure
  - Avoid duplication (apply DRY)
- Correctness:
  - Handle edge cases
  - Use input validation and error handling
  - Organize testable code (suggest where unit/integration tests are needed)
- Efficiency:
  - Use efficient algorithms and data structures
  - Avoid unnecessary processing or database queries
- Scalability:
  - Use modular architecture (MVC, services, helpers)
  - Avoid tight coupling
- Security:
  - Validate and sanitize inputs
  - Protect environment variables
  - Prevent common vulnerabilities (e.g., injection, data leaks)
- Documentation:
  - Include a README
  - Provide basic API documentation/comments explaining “why”, not “what”
  - Use clear commit messages and version control best practices

**Folder structure should be clear and logical, for example:**
```
hustlr/
  app/
    main.py
    api/
      whatsapp.py
      providers.py
      booking.py
    models/
      user.py
      provider.py
      booking.py
    utils/
      reminders.py
      webhook_verifier.py
  requirements.txt
  .env.example
  README.md
```

**Requirements:**
- Code must be clean, readable, and maintainable
- Clear docstrings and minimal but meaningful comments 
- Input validation for user/provider registration
- MongoDB integration for user and provider data
- Example endpoints for WhatsApp webhook, provider registration, user onboarding, and booking
- Suggest places for unit tests (don’t need to write all test cases)
- Follow PEP8 conventions, handle errors gracefully

**Do**:
- Demonstrate with actual Python code (FastAPI + Motor for MongoDB)
- Name everything clearly
- Show at least one endpoint for each major feature (user onboarding, provider registration, booking)

**Do NOT**:
- Skip code for critical parts
- Add unnecessary complexity
- Output code without explanations

Make the codebase something another developer can jump into, understand, and maintain with confidence.
