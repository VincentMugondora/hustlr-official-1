**3. Functional Requirements**

**A. Provider Registration**
- Triggered when provider sends a “register” keyword.
- Bot collects:
  - Full name
  - Service type (plumber, electrician, etc.)
  - Location
  - Optional: business name, contact details
- Stores provider profile in MongoDB with status (pending/approved/active).

**B. User Onboarding (First Visit)**
- On new user’s first message:
  - Bot prompts for: name
  - Then asks: location
  - Then: presents privacy policy (summarized) and asks to agree (“yes”/“no”)
- Only after all data collected and privacy agreed does bot proceed to service access.
- Store all info in MongoDB (users collection).

**C. Booking & Reminders**
- User browses or searches for provider types.
- Bot matches user with available, relevant providers.
- User selects provider, chooses date/time for booking.
- Booking event stored (MongoDB).
- Automated WhatsApp reminders sent to user & provider before appointment time.

**4. Database Design (MongoDB collections)**

- **users**
  - _id
  - whatsapp_number
  - name
  - location
  - agreed_privacy_policy (bool)

  - name
  - service_type
  - location
  - status (pending/active)
  - registered_at

- **bookings**

  - provider_id (ref)
  - date_time
  - status (pending/confirmed/completed)

***

**5. Acceptance Criteria**

- Providers can register entirely via WhatsApp; details are stored in MongoDB.
- New users are blocked from search/booking until name, location, and privacy policy agreement are collected and saved.
- Bookings and reminders are handled automatically.
- All data–user, provider, bookings–are centrally managed in MongoDB.

***

**6. Non-Functional Requirements**
- All sensitive data is securely stored and complies with applicable privacy policy.
- The bot is responsive (avg. < 2s reply to WhatsApp).
- High reliability—retries failed WhatsApp messages.
- Scalable to support at least 1000 concurrent users.
